To recreate after cloning, in the project directory, run:

```
    npm install
    npm start
```

Took me ~ 12 hours on this enjoyable project. It came out fairly well in the time frame, all mandatory and otherwise requirements met. What is clearly lacking though is a distinction between a booking and previous time log in the daily log list. Also, right now you can make an appointment in the past (earlier in the same day) - which is a bug!

Future improvements I will make with more time:

Fix the past appointment bug

Create a visual distinction between appointments (appointments would have a guest list, venue, time dedicated to it etc) 

Previous logs and upcoming days with appointments would have a "deadline" emoji on their calendar dates

When it is time to give a user about an appointment, there would be a custom alert with more details of the appointment and link to a call etc.
